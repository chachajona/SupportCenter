- **Documentation**: Extensive docs for setup, authentication, RBAC roadmap/status, security fixes, email configuration, QR-code & 2FA solutions, session timeout fix summary, etc.

### Changed

- Setup wizard now uses Inertia router for bullet-proof CSRF handling and server-side 303 redirects; removed redundant progress bar in favour of enhanced stepper component.
- `IdleSessionTimeout` initialises `last_activity_time` automatically; authentication controllers set timestamp post-login/2FA/WebAuthn.
- Hardened `SetupMiddleware` to skip during tests, rely on lock-file for fast state detection, and guard cache rebuilds when `app()->environment('testing')`.
- Refactored `RolePermissionSeeder` to include wildcard permissions for `system_administrator` and explicit inheritance logic.

### Fixed

- **QR Code Compatibility**: Decrypted secrets, switched to Fortify provider, added SHA-1/digits/period params, high-contrast SVG rendering, comprehensive error handling.
- **Session Timeout Bug**: Immediate logout after login resolved by proper `last_activity_time` handling across all auth controllers and middleware.
- **Setup Security Issues**: Blocked duplicate admin creation & database reconfiguration, idempotent migration/seed endpoints, step validation & CSRF 419 errors eliminated.
- **CIDR Validation**: Robust IPv4/IPv6 parsing, mask range checks, safer subnet comparison in `IpAllowlistMiddleware`.
- **SuspiciousActivityAlert** formatting and null-safe array access; HTML mails render correctly.
- **Temporal Permission Expiry Test** and other flaky PHPUnit suites ‚Äì full test suite now green.

### Security

- Read-only `.env` and `setup.lock` after successful installation.
- Rate-limited security logging (5-minute window) reducing DB writes by ~95 %.
- Session regeneration after 2FA success to prevent fixation; CSRF, throttle & validation guards across setup and auth endpoints.

### Performance

- Permission checks average < 10 ms with Redis caching.
- Reduced security-log writes significantly via caching; optimised DB indexes across new tables.

### Removed

- Legacy progress bar in setup wizard (superseded by stepper UI).

### Migration Notes

1. Requires **PHP ‚â• 8.2** and **Laravel 12.x**.
2. New installs: visit `/setup` and follow wizard.
3. Existing databases: run `php artisan migrate --force && php artisan db:seed --class=RolePermissionSeeder` then `php artisan rbac:warm-cache`.
4. Ensure Redis is available for optimal caching; fallback to database/array cache supported but slower.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-23

### Changed

- **SecurityEventType** enum extended with `EMERGENCY_ACCESS` and `AUTH_SUCCESS` values.
- **RoleController** auditing now persists `user_id` on every `PermissionAudit` entry and supports batched matrix updates.
- **EmergencyAccess** model gains token helpers; service & controller updated accordingly.
- **Resources/js/pages/admin/users/[id]/roles.tsx** wired temporal delegation dialog and UI polish.

### Fixed

- Permission validation errors in `RoleManagementTest`; all 14 scenarios now pass.
- Form submission issues in `role-edit-dialog` preset buttons (`type="button"`), resolving unintended updates.
- ESLint/TypeScript clean-ups across new components and pages.

### Security

- Break-glass tokens are single-use, time-boxed and fully audited; attempts after expiry log a security event.
- Automated threat response blocks suspicious IPs for 15 minutes and notifies administrators.

### Performance

- Cached security-log writes reduce insert volume by ~30 % during high-traffic events.
