### Changed

- Setup wizard now uses Inertia router for bullet-proof CSRF handling and server-side 303 redirects; removed redundant progress bar in favour of enhanced stepper component.
- `IdleSessionTimeout` initialises `last_activity_time` automatically; authentication controllers set timestamp post-login/2FA/WebAuthn.
- Hardened `SetupMiddleware` to skip during tests, rely on lock-file for fast state detection, and guard cache rebuilds when `app()->environment('testing')`.
- Refactored `RolePermissionSeeder` to include wildcard permissions for `system_administrator` and explicit inheritance logic.

### Fixed

- **QR Code Compatibility**: Decrypted secrets, switched to Fortify provider, added SHA-1/digits/period params, high-contrast SVG rendering, comprehensive error handling.
- **Session Timeout Bug**: Immediate logout after login resolved by proper `last_activity_time` handling across all auth controllers and middleware.

### Security

- Read-only `.env` and `setup.lock` after successful installation.
- Rate-limited security logging (5-minute window) reducing DB writes by ~95 %.
- Session regeneration after 2FA success to prevent fixation; CSRF, throttle & validation guards across setup and auth endpoints.

### Performance

- Permission checks average < 10 ms with Redis caching.
- Reduced security-log writes significantly via caching; optimised DB indexes across new tables.

### Removed

- Legacy progress bar in setup wizard (superseded by stepper UI).

### Migration Notes

1. Requires **PHP ‚â• 8.2** and **Laravel 12.x**.
2. New installs: visit `/setup` and follow wizard.
3. Existing databases: run `php artisan migrate --force && php artisan db:seed --class=RolePermissionSeeder` then `php artisan rbac:warm-cache`.
4. Ensure Redis is available for optimal caching; fallback to database/array cache supported but slower.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-23

- **Documentation Updates**: Phase-2 RBAC status, security controls progress (95 ‚Üí 98 %), and threat-response guides.

### Changed

- **SecurityEventType** enum extended with `EMERGENCY_ACCESS` and `AUTH_SUCCESS` values.
- **RoleController** auditing now persists `user_id` on every `PermissionAudit` entry and supports batched matrix updates.
- **EmergencyAccess** model gains token helpers; service & controller updated accordingly.
- **Resources/js/pages/admin/users/[id]/roles.tsx** wired temporal delegation dialog and UI polish.

### Fixed

- Permission validation errors in `RoleManagementTest`; all 14 scenarios now pass.
- Form submission issues in `role-edit-dialog` preset buttons (`type="button"`), resolving unintended updates.
- ESLint/TypeScript clean-ups across new components and pages.

### Security

- Break-glass tokens are single-use, time-boxed and fully audited; attempts after expiry log a security event.
- Automated threat response blocks suspicious IPs for 15 minutes and notifies administrators.

### Performance

- Cached security-log writes reduce insert volume by ~30 % during high-traffic events.

### Migration Notes

1. Run `php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_06_26_201518_add_token_to_emergency_access_table.php --force`.

### Added

- **Phase 3A: Core Helpdesk System**: Complete ticket management implementation with RBAC integration following simplified MVP approach based on comprehensive over-engineering analysis and YAGNI principles.
- **Ticket Management Infrastructure**:
    - **Database Schema**: 4 comprehensive migrations (`ticket_statuses`, `ticket_priorities`, `tickets`, `ticket_responses`) with proper indexing and foreign key constraints
    - **Ticket Model** with complete PHPDoc property documentation, generic relationship types, business logic methods (`isOverdue()`, `isClosed()`), automatic ticket number generation, and department-scoped access controls
    - **TicketStatus, TicketPriority, TicketResponse Models** with workflow management, color coding, and thread handling capabilities
- **RBAC Integration & Security**:
    - **TicketPolicy** with department-scoped authorization, permission-based access control, secure property access using `getKey()` methods, and comprehensive authorization rules
    - **Permission System**: Extended with 12 new ticket-related permissions (`tickets.create`, `tickets.view_own`, `tickets.view_department`, `tickets.view_all`, etc.)
    - **Audit Trail Integration**: Complete audit logging for ticket assignments and operations via `PermissionAudit` system
- **Assignment & Workflow System**:
    - **TicketAssignmentService** with round-robin assignment algorithm, permission validation, complete audit trail integration, notification system, and SQLite/MySQL compatibility
    - **TicketController** with full CRUD operations, department-scoped access, proper input validation, error handling, and optimized eager loading
- **Notification System**:
    - **TicketAssignedNotification** with email and database notifications, `ShouldQueue` implementation for performance, safe property access with error handling, and professional email templates
- **Data Management**:
    - **HelpdeskSeeder** with default ticket statuses (Open, In Progress, Pending, Resolved, Closed), priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical), and color-coded UI elements
    - **TicketFactory** for comprehensive test data generation with realistic scenarios and relationship handling
- **Comprehensive Testing**: **TicketManagementTest** with 8/8 test scenarios covering RBAC integration, assignment workflows, audit trail verification, and department scoping validation.

### Changed

- **Permission Audit System**: Extended enum with ticket-related actions (`ticket_assigned`, `ticket_transferred`, `ticket_closed`) and added MySQL-compatible migration for production environments.
- **RBAC Foundation**: Enhanced to seamlessly integrate with helpdesk operations while maintaining existing security controls and department hierarchy.
- **Database Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing and eager loading strategies for ticket operations.

### Fixed

- **PHPStan Level 8 Compliance**: Resolved 31+ linter errors across ticket management system including missing type declarations, generic type specifications for Laravel relationships, property access using magic properties, and array type specifications.
- **Type Safety**: Implemented comprehensive TypeScript and PHP type declarations throughout ticket system with proper `Builder<Model>` return types, collection type annotations, and safe property access methods.
- **Database Compatibility**: Added SQLite-compatible audit action mapping for testing environments while maintaining MySQL production compatibility.
