# Phase 1: Modern Authentication Layer Implementation Roadmap
Framework Selection

Chosen Framework: Laravel 12
Justification: Laravel 12 provides rapid development, robust authentication via Sanctum, and seamless React integration, ideal for osTicket SCP. Sanctum handles SPA authentication, with tymon/jwt-auth reserved for future stateless API clients.

## Milestone 1.1: Core Authentication System (Weeks 1-6)
### Weeks 1-2: Foundation Architecture

Implement SPA authentication using Laravel Sanctum for the React SCP.
Configure CSRF protection for the React SPA.
Set up password hashing with automatic rehashing using Laravel's bcrypt.
Testing: Unit tests for Sanctum endpoints using PHPUnit.
Compliance: Design GDPR right-to-erasure mechanism (e.g., user deletion endpoint).

### Weeks 3-4: Multi-Factor Authentication

Implement WebAuthn (Passkeys) for secure MFA using `Laragear/WebAuthn`, prioritizing SPA users.
Set up backup code system as an MFA fallback using `Laragear/TwoFactor`.
Add device fingerprinting for enhanced security.
Testing: Integration tests for MFA flows using PHPUnit, with browser compatibility tests for WebAuthn (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with `Laragear/WebAuthn`.
Compliance: Ensure MFA logs are auditable for HIPAA (preliminary logging setup).

### Weeks 5-6: Buffer and Testing

Conduct thorough testing of authentication and MFA systems.
Address issues identified during testing. Concurrent with JWT work
Compliance: Finalize GDPR right-to-erasure implementation and test deletion workflows.

## Milestone 1.2: Session Management (Weeks 7-12)
### Weeks 7-8: SPA Session Management

Configure idle session timeout for SPA sessions (e.g., 30 minutes).
Ensure robust session invalidation on logout.
Testing: Tests for session timeout and logout using PHPUnit and Jest (React).
Compliance: Log session activities for HIPAA audit trail preparation.

### Weeks 9-10: Security Hardening

Set up rate limiting (10 attempts per 5 minutes) using Laravel's Redis-based rate limiter with monitoring.
Implement IP allowlisting with database-stored audit logs.
Add suspicious activity detection with email alerts via Laravel's notification system.
Testing: Security and penetration testing using tools like OWASP ZAP.

### Weeks 11-12: Buffer and Testing

Conduct comprehensive testing of session management and security features.
Ensure security measures are effective and user-friendly.
Compliance: Validate HIPAA logging and prepare documentation.

Immediate Action Items

Load Testing: Test with 10,000 concurrent auth requests using tools like Locust.
Rollback Plan: Develop a detailed plan, including database backups, legacy system testing, and stakeholder communication.
Compliance Timeline:
GDPR right-to-erasure: Fully integrated by end of Phase 1.
HIPAA audit trail: Logging in place; full implementation in Phase 2.



Critical Path Analysis

Database Optimization: Optimize database for performance (e.g., indexing); plan sharding for future phases.
Time-Series Storage: Evaluate for authentication logs, prioritize core features.
Load Testing: Conduct with 10,000 concurrent requests.

Dependency Management

External Libraries: Monitor `Laragear/WebAuthn`, `Laragear/TwoFactor`, and zxcvbn 4.0 for updates.
Fallback Plans: Use custom WebAuthn implementation or alternative password strength libraries if needed.

User Training and Documentation

Developer Training: Document authentication system (setup, configuration, maintenance) by Week 10.
End-User Guides: Create staff guides for SCP authentication, delivered by Week 12.
